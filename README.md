#  Manhole Detection and Monitoring System

Welcome to the  Manhole Detection and Monitoring System. This system is designed to enhance the safety of Manholes by providing real-time monitoring of gases, quantity and and tracking capabilities. By incorporating IoT technology, this project aims at preventing accidents and casualties.

## Components
To build the  Manhole Detection and Monitoring System, you will need the following components:

1. ESP8266 WiFi Module
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. OLED (128*64)
4. Gas Sensor (MQ 9)
5. Arduino UNO
6. Wirings
7. Buzzer

## Extra libraries
The extranal librarires used in the project.
1. Adafrui GFX
2. Blynk
3. Wire
4. ESP8266WiFi
5. Adafruit SSD1306
6. BlynkSimpleEsp8266



## Installation and Setup

To set up the system, follow these steps:

-**Hardware Assembly**: Connect the components according to the circuit diagram and ensure all electrical connections are secure. Take care to follow proper wiring practices and double-check the connections.

-**Software Configuration**: Upload the firmware to the ATmega controller using the appropriate programming tool or IDE. Make sure to configure the WiFi module with the necessary credentials for internet connectivity.

-**Power Supply**: Connect the power adapter to the power port of the system, ensuring the correct voltage and polarity. Verify that all components are receiving power and functioning properly.

-**Operation**: Once the system is set up and configured, it will start monitoring manhole in real-time. The OLED display will show the data, and in case of any limit crossings, an SMS alert will be sent and the buzzer will be active.
